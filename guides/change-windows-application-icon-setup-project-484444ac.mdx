# Change Windows Application Icon in C# Setup Projects

When deploying a C# desktop application using a Visual Studio Setup Project, you might notice that the shortcuts created (e.g., on the desktop or in the Start Menu) don't automatically inherit your application's custom icon. Instead, they often display a generic Windows icon. This guide explains how to correctly set your custom icon for application shortcuts and the Add/Remove Programs entry.

## Quick Answer

To change the icon for application shortcuts in a Visual Studio Setup Project:

1.  Ensure your main application project has the desired icon set in its properties.
2.  In the Setup Project, go to **View -> File System**.
3.  Locate the shortcut (e.g., under "User's Programs Menu"), right-click, and select **Properties Window**.
4.  In the Properties window, click the **Icon** field, then **Browse...**.
5.  Change "Files of type" to `*.exe`, browse to your `Primary output` (your application's `.exe`), and select it.

For the Add/Remove Programs icon, select the Setup Project, and in its properties, set the `AddRemoveProgramsIcon` property to your desired `.ico` file or the `Primary output`.

## Choose Your Method

Deciding how to set your application's icon depends on where you want the icon to appear and your specific needs.

    C -- Yes --> E[In Setup Project: View -> File System];
    E --> F[Select shortcut (e.g., User's Programs Menu)];
    F --> G[Open Properties Window for shortcut];
    G --> H[Click Icon field -> Browse...];
    H --> I[Change "Files of type" to *.exe];
    I --> J[Browse to and select Primary output];
    J --> K[OK, OK];
    K --> L{Want to change Add/Remove Programs icon?};
    L -- Yes --> M[Select Setup Project in Solution Explorer];
    M --> N[In Properties window, set AddRemoveProgramsIcon];
    N --> O[Select .ico file or Primary output];
    O --> P[End];
    L -- No --> P;
    B -- No --> L;
```

## Working Code Examples

While setting icons in a Setup Project is primarily a UI-driven process in Visual Studio, the underlying principle involves ensuring your main application's executable has an embedded icon and then referencing that executable or a separate `.ico` file within the installer.

### 1. Setting the Application Icon in the Main Project

Before configuring the Setup Project, ensure your C# application itself has the desired icon embedded. This is crucial as the Setup Project will often pull the icon from here.

1.  **Right-click** on your C# application project (not the Setup Project) in the Solution Explorer.
2.  Select **Properties**.
3.  Go to the **Application** tab.
4.  Under the "Resources" section, ensure the "Icon and manifest" radio button is selected.
5.  Click the **Browse...** button next to the "Icon" dropdown and select your `.ico` file.

### 2. Changing Shortcut Icons in the Setup Project

This is the most common scenario where the generic icon appears.

1.  In **Solution Explorer**, right-click on your **Setup Project**.
2.  Go to **View -> File System**.

3.  In the "File System on Target Machine" window, navigate to the location where your shortcut is created (e.g., `User's Programs Menu` or `User's Desktop`).
4.  **Right-click** on the shortcut whose icon you want to change (e.g., "Shortcut to Primary output from YourApp").
5.  Select **Properties Window**.
6.  In the Properties window, find the **Icon** property. It will likely say `(None)` or `(Default)`.
7.  Click the `...` button next to the `Icon` field.
8.  In the "Select Icon" dialog, click **Browse...**.
9.  In the "Open" dialog, change "Files of type" to `*.exe`.
10. Navigate to your application's `Primary output` (usually found under `Application Folder`). Select it and click **Open**.
11. You should now see your application's icon(s) in the "Select Icon" dialog. Choose the desired icon and click **OK**.

### 3. Changing the Add/Remove Programs Icon

This icon appears in the Windows "Add or Remove Programs" list (or "Programs and Features").

1.  In **Solution Explorer**, select your **Setup Project**.
2.  In the **Properties Window** (usually on the right), locate the `AddRemoveProgramsIcon` property.
3.  Click the `...` button next to the `AddRemoveProgramsIcon` field.
4.  You can either:
    *   Select an existing `.ico` file from your project.
    *   Browse to your `Primary output` (your `.exe`) and select it, similar to the shortcut method. The installer will then extract the icon from your executable.

## Common Problems & Solutions

### 1. Icon Not Displaying / Generic Icon Still Appears

*   **Problem**: After following the steps, the icon still doesn't show, or a generic icon appears.
*   **Solution**:
    *   **Icon Size**: Ensure your `.ico` file is not too large. While modern Windows supports larger icons, older Setup Projects or specific system configurations might struggle. Common working sizes are 16x16, 32x32, 48x48, 64x64, or 128x128 pixels. A 256x256 icon might cause issues. It's best to have multiple sizes embedded within a single `.ico` file.
    *   **Icon File Name**: Some users have reported issues with very long or complex `.ico` file names. Try renaming your `.ico` file to something short and simple (e.g., `app.ico`).
    *   **Rebuild and Reinstall**: Always rebuild your Setup Project after making changes and then uninstall any previous versions of your application before reinstalling the new one. Windows sometimes caches old icon information.
    *   **Verify Main Project Icon**: Double-check that your main C# application project (not the Setup Project) has the icon correctly set in its properties (Application tab). The Setup Project often pulls from this.

### 2. "OK" Button Greyed Out in Icon Selection Dialog

*   **Problem**: When browsing for an `.exe` to select its icon, the "OK" button in the "Select Icon" dialog is greyed out after selecting the `.exe`.
*   **Solution**: This usually means the dialog expects you to select *an icon within* the `.exe`, not just the `.exe` itself. After selecting the `.exe` and clicking "Open", the dialog should then populate with the icons found inside that `.exe`. You then need to click on one of the displayed icons to highlight it, which should enable the "OK" button. If no icons appear, your `.exe` might not have an embedded icon, or the `.ico` file used to build it was problematic.

## Summary

Customizing the icons for your C# desktop application within a Visual Studio Setup Project involves a few distinct steps. First, ensure your main application project has its icon properly embedded. Then, configure the Setup Project to reference this executable for shortcut icons and either the executable or a dedicated `.ico` file for the Add/Remove Programs entry. Pay attention to `.ico` file size and naming conventions to avoid common pitfalls. By following these steps, you can ensure your deployed application presents a professional and branded appearance to users.

**PLACEHOLDER-1:** A screenshot of Visual Studio's Project Properties window for a C# Windows Forms application. The "Application" tab is selected. Highlight the "Icon and manifest" section, specifically the "Icon" dropdown and the "Browse..." button next to it. The dropdown should show a selected `.ico` file.

**PLACEHOLDER-2:** A screenshot of Visual Studio's Solution Explorer with a Setup Project selected. A context menu is open on the Setup Project, and the "View" submenu is expanded, with "File System" highlighted. The "File System on Target Machine" window should be visible in the background, showing folders like "Application Folder", "User's Desktop", "User's Programs Menu".

**PLACEHOLDER-3:** A screenshot of Visual Studio's "File System on Target Machine" window. The "User's Programs Menu" folder is selected, and a shortcut (e.g., "Shortcut to Primary output from MyCoolApp") is highlighted. A "Properties Window" pane is open, showing the properties of this shortcut. The "Icon" property is highlighted, and a "Select Icon" dialog box is open on top of it, showing several icon sizes extracted from an `.exe` file. One of the icons is selected, and the "OK" button is enabled.

**PLACEHOLDER-4:** A screenshot of Visual Studio's Properties Window. The Setup Project is selected in the Solution Explorer (not visible, but implied). The Properties Window shows various properties for the Setup Project. Highlight the `AddRemoveProgramsIcon` property, with its value showing a path to an `.ico` file or `(Primary output from MyCoolApp)`. The `...` button next to the property should be visible.

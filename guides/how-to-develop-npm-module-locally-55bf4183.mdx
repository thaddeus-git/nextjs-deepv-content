# How to Develop npm Modules Locally with `npm link`

When developing an application that relies on a custom npm module, a common challenge is setting up an efficient workflow for local development. Manually copying changes or repeatedly running `npm install /path/to/module` can be cumbersome and slow. This guide focuses on using `npm link` to create a seamless development experience, allowing you to make changes to your module and see them reflected instantly in your main application.

## Quick Answer

The most effective way to develop an npm module locally is by using `npm link`. This command creates symbolic links, allowing your main application to use a local version of your module as if it were installed from the npm registry.

1.  **In your module's directory (`MyModule`):**
    ```bash
    npm link
    ```
2.  **In your application's directory (`MyApp`):**
    ```bash
    npm link MyModule
    ```

This sets up a live link, so changes saved in `MyModule` are immediately available in `MyApp`.

## Choose Your Method

The `npm link` command is the primary and most recommended method for local npm module development. There are slight variations, but the core principle remains the same.

    I --> J[Manual updates needed];

## Ready-to-Use Code

Here are the essential commands for setting up `npm link`:

### Step 1: Link Your Module Globally

Navigate to your module's root directory (e.g., `~/projects/MyModule`) and run:

```bash
cd ~/projects/MyModule
npm link
```

This command registers your `MyModule` with npm's global `node_modules` directory, creating a symbolic link from the global space to your local module's directory.

### Step 2: Link Your Application to the Global Module

Navigate to your application's root directory (e.g., `~/projects/MyApp`) and run:

```bash
cd ~/projects/MyApp
npm link MyModule
```

This command creates a symbolic link from your application's `node_modules` directory to the global link created in Step 1, which in turn points to your local `MyModule` directory.

### Alternative: Direct Relative Path Linking

For a slightly more direct approach, you can link using a relative path from your application's directory:

```bash
cd ~/projects/MyApp
npm link ../MyModule
```

This command directly links your application's `node_modules` to the local `MyModule` directory, bypassing the global link step. This can be simpler for closely located projects.

## Method 1: Using `npm link` (Recommended)

The `npm link` command is designed specifically for this use case. It creates a symlink (symbolic link) that allows your application to reference your local module directly.

### How it Works

1.  **Global Symlink Creation:** When you run `npm link` inside your module's directory, npm creates a global symlink. This symlink points from a location in npm's global package directory (e.g., `/usr/local/lib/node_modules/MyModule` on Unix-like systems) to your actual local module directory (e.g., `~/projects/MyModule`).
2.  **Local Symlink Creation:** When you run `npm link MyModule` inside your application's directory, npm creates another symlink. This one points from your application's `node_modules/MyModule` to the global symlink created in step 1.

The result is that any `require('MyModule')` or `import MyModule from 'MyModule'` statements in your application will resolve to your local `MyModule` directory. Any changes you save in `~/projects/MyModule` will be immediately available in `~/projects/MyApp` without needing to reinstall or copy files.

### Example Workflow

Let's assume your project structure is:

```
~/projects/
├── MyApp/
│   └── package.json
│   └── index.js
└── MyModule/
    └── package.json
    └── src/
        └── main.js
```

1.  **Prepare `MyModule`:**
    ```bash
    cd ~/projects/MyModule
    npm link
    ```
    You should see output similar to:
    ```
    /usr/local/lib/node_modules/mymodule -> /Users/youruser/projects/MyModule
    ```

2.  **Link `MyApp` to `MyModule`:**
    ```bash
    cd ~/projects/MyApp
    npm link MyModule
    ```
    This will create a `node_modules/MyModule` symlink in your `MyApp` directory.

Now, if `MyApp/index.js` contains `const myModule = require('MyModule');`, it will load `~/projects/MyModule/src/main.js` (or whatever your `main` entry point is in `MyModule/package.json`).

## Common Problems & Solutions

### 1. `npm link` not working or resolving correctly

*   **Problem:** After linking, changes aren't reflected, or the module isn't found.
*   **Solution:**
    *   Ensure you ran `npm link` in the module directory *first*, then `npm link <module-name>` in the app directory.
    *   Check the `node_modules` folder in your app. You should see `MyModule` as a symlink (often indicated by an arrow or different icon in file explorers).
    *   Sometimes, deleting `node_modules` and `package-lock.json` in `MyApp`, then running `npm install` followed by `npm link MyModule` again, can resolve issues.
    *   Verify the `name` field in `MyModule/package.json` matches the name you use in `npm link MyModule`.

### 2. Debugging linked modules

*   **Problem:** `console.log` is insufficient, and you want to use a debugger (e.g., VS Code).
*   **Solution:** Most modern debuggers (like VS Code's Node.js debugger) can follow symlinks.
    *   Set breakpoints directly in your `MyModule` source files.
    *   When running your `MyApp` with the debugger attached, the debugger should hit breakpoints in the linked `MyModule` code.
    *   Ensure your `MyApp`'s `launch.json` configuration is set up correctly for Node.js debugging.

### 3. Versioning conflicts with `npm link`

*   **Problem:** `npm link` bypasses version checks. If multiple applications need different versions of `MyModule`, `npm link` will always point to your single local development version.
*   **Solution:** `npm link` is primarily for *active development* of a single version. For testing different versions or in a microservice environment where strict versioning is critical, `npm link` is not suitable. In such cases, you might need to:
    *   Publish different versions to a private npm registry.
    *   Use tools like `yalc` (Yet Another Local Cache) which acts as a local npm registry, allowing you to "publish" local packages and "add" them to projects with versioning.
    *   Manually `npm install /path/to/module` for specific version testing, accepting the need to reinstall after changes.

### 4. Unlinking a module

*   **Problem:** You're done developing locally and want to revert to the published version.
*   **Solution:**
    1.  **In your application's directory (`MyApp`):**
        ```bash
        npm unlink MyModule
        ```
        This removes the symlink from `MyApp/node_modules`.
    2.  **In your module's directory (`MyModule`):**
        ```bash
        npm unlink
        ```
        This removes the global symlink.
    3.  After unlinking, you'll likely need to run `npm install` in `MyApp` to get the published version of `MyModule` back.

### 5. Checking linked dependencies

*   **Problem:** You want to see which modules are currently linked.
*   **Solution:**
    *   To see linked dependencies in your current project:
        ```bash
        npm ls --link
        ```
    *   To see all globally linked packages:
        ```bash
        npm ls --global --depth=0
        ```
        This will show you the global symlinks created by `npm link` in your module directories.

## Summary

`npm link` is an indispensable tool for local npm module development, providing a fast and efficient way to test changes without constant reinstallation. By understanding its two-step process and how to manage common issues, you can significantly streamline your development workflow. Remember to `npm unlink` when you're done with local development to revert to published versions.

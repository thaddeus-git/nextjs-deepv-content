# Dependency Resolution Fails on Installed Library: Complete Guide with 5 Solutions

## Quick Answer

The most common reason for "Dependency Resolution Fails" errors, especially concerning `libcrypto.so.10(libcrypto.so.10)(64bit)`, even when `libcrypto.so.10` appears to be present, is a mismatch in the *module names* provided by your installed `openssl` or `openssl-libs` package. The RPM system checks not just for the library file but also for specific module versions embedded within it.

To resolve this quickly, especially on CentOS/RHEL 6/7, you often need to upgrade your `openssl` or `openssl-libs` package to a version that provides the required module names.

For CentOS 7, a common fix involves directly installing a compatible `openssl-libs` RPM:

```bash
# Download the appropriate openssl-libs RPM for your CentOS/RHEL 7 system
# (Always verify the URL and version for your specific OS release)
wget http://mirror.centos.org/centos/7/os/x86_64/Packages/openssl-libs-1.0.2k-16.el7.x86_64.rpm

# Install it, forcing if necessary to overwrite older versions (use with caution)
sudo rpm -ivh openssl-libs-1.0.2k-16.el7.x86_64.rpm --force

# Then retry your original package installation
sudo yum install your-package-name.rpm
```

For CentOS 6, you might need to target a specific `openssl` package:

```bash
# Download the appropriate openssl RPM for your CentOS/RHEL 6 system
# (Always verify the URL and version for your specific OS release)
sudo yum install http://mirror.centos.org/centos/6/os/x86_64/Packages/openssl-1.0.1e-15.el6.x86_64.rpm

# Then retry your original package installation
sudo yum install your-package-name.rpm
```

This typically ensures that the `openssl` package provides the `libcrypto.so.10(libcrypto.so.10)(64bit)` module name that your target application's RPM is explicitly looking for.

## Ready-to-Use Code

Here are the most effective, copy-paste solutions for common scenarios.

### Scenario 1: CentOS/RHEL 7+ - Missing `libcrypto.so.10(libcrypto.so.10)(64bit)` module
This is the most frequent issue. Your `openssl-libs` package is likely too old and doesn't provide the specific module name required by the new RPM.

```bash
# 1. Identify your CentOS/RHEL version to get the correct URL.
#    Example for CentOS 7 (adjust for specific minor version if needed, e.g., 7.9.2009)
OS_VERSION=$(grep -oP '(?<=^VERSION_ID=")[0-9]' /etc/os-release)
ARCH=$(uname -m)

if [ "$OS_VERSION" == "7" ]; then
    # Find the latest stable openssl-libs for CentOS 7 from a reliable mirror
    # (Always verify the URL and package name on the mirror before running in production)
    # Example: openssl-libs-1.0.2k-26.el7_9.x86_64.rpm (as of late 2024/early 2025)
    # You might need to browse http://mirror.centos.org/centos/7/updates/x86_64/Packages/
    # or http://mirror.centos.org/centos/7/os/x86_64/Packages/ for the exact latest version.
    OPENSSL_LIBS_RPM_URL="http://mirror.centos.org/centos/7/updates/x86_64/Packages/openssl-libs-1.0.2k-26.el7_9.x86_64.rpm"
    echo "Attempting to download openssl-libs for CentOS 7 from: $OPENSSL_LIBS_RPM_URL"
    wget -q --show-progress "$OPENSSL_LIBS_RPM_URL" -O openssl-libs.rpm

    if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
        echo "Download successful. Installing openssl-libs..."
        sudo rpm -Uvh openssl-libs.rpm --force # Use -Uvh for upgrade, --force if needed
        if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
            echo "openssl-libs installed/upgraded successfully. Retrying original package installation."
            # Replace 'your-problematic-package.rpm' with the actual package you're trying to install
            # sudo yum install your-problematic-package.rpm
        else
            echo "Failed to install openssl-libs. Check error messages above."
        fi
        rm openssl-libs.rpm
    else
        echo "Failed to download openssl-libs. Please check the URL and your network connection."
    fi
else
    echo "This script is tailored for CentOS/RHEL 7. Please adapt for your OS version."
fi
```

### Scenario 2: CentOS/RHEL 6 - Missing `libcrypto.so.10(libcrypto.so.10)(64bit)` module
Similar to CentOS 7, but targets the `openssl` package directly for older systems.

```bash
# 1. Identify your CentOS/RHEL version.
OS_VERSION=$(grep -oP '(?<=^VERSION_ID=")[0-9]' /etc/os-release)
ARCH=$(uname -m)

if [ "$OS_VERSION" == "6" ]; then
    # Find the latest stable openssl for CentOS 6 from a reliable mirror
    # (Always verify the URL and package name on the mirror before running in production)
    # Example: openssl-1.0.1e-60.el6_10.x86_64.rpm (as of late 2024/early 2025)
    # You might need to browse http://mirror.centos.org/centos/6/updates/x86_64/Packages/
    # or http://mirror.centos.org/centos/6/os/x86_64/Packages/ for the exact latest version.
    OPENSSL_RPM_URL="http://mirror.centos.org/centos/6/updates/x86_64/Packages/openssl-1.0.1e-60.el6_10.x86_64.rpm"
    echo "Attempting to download openssl for CentOS 6 from: $OPENSSL_RPM_URL"
    wget -q --show-progress "$OPENSSL_RPM_URL" -O openssl.rpm

    if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
        echo "Download successful. Installing openssl..."
        sudo rpm -Uvh openssl.rpm --force # Use -Uvh for upgrade, --force if needed
        if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
            echo "openssl installed/upgraded successfully. Retrying original package installation."
            # Replace 'your-problematic-package.rpm' with the actual package you're trying to install
            # sudo yum install your-problematic-package.rpm
        else
            echo "Failed to install openssl. Check error messages above."
        fi
        rm openssl.rpm
    else
        echo "Failed to download openssl. Please check the URL and your network connection."
    fi
else
    echo "This script is tailored for CentOS/RHEL 6. Please adapt for your OS version."
fi
```

### Scenario 3: `openssl` or `openssl-libs` is excluded in YUM configuration
If you're in a managed environment, critical packages might be excluded from updates.

```bash
# 1. Backup your yum.conf before making changes
sudo cp /etc/yum.conf /etc/yum.conf.bak

# 2. Check if openssl or openssl-libs is in the exclude list
echo "Current exclude list in /etc/yum.conf:"
grep "^exclude=" /etc/yum.conf

# 3. Remove openssl* from the exclude line.
#    Use a text editor like 'vi' or 'nano' to manually edit:
#    sudo vi /etc/yum.conf
#    Locate the line starting with 'exclude=' and remove 'openssl*' from it.
#    Example:
#    Before: exclude=kernel* openssl*
#    After:  exclude=kernel*

#    Alternatively, use sed (use with caution, test first):
#    sudo sed -i '/^exclude=/ s/\<openssl\*\>//g' /etc/yum.conf
#    sudo sed -i '/^exclude=/ s/  */ /g' /etc/yum.conf # Clean up double spaces

echo "Please manually edit /etc/yum.conf to remove 'openssl*' from the 'exclude=' line."
echo "After editing, save the file and then run:"
echo "sudo yum clean all"
echo "sudo yum update openssl-libs openssl"
echo "Then retry your original package installation."
```

## Method 1: Understanding Module Names and Upgrading `openssl-libs` (CentOS/RHEL 7+)

**Persona:** 📚 Learning Explorer, 🔧 Problem Solver, 🚀 Speed Seeker

This method addresses the core of the problem: the RPM dependency system doesn't just look for the presence of a shared library file (like `libcrypto.so.10`), but also for specific *module names* or *symbols* that the library is expected to provide. These module names are often listed in parentheses, e.g., `libcrypto.so.10(libcrypto.so.10)(64bit)`.

The issue arises when an older version of `openssl-libs` (or `openssl`) is installed, and it provides `libcrypto.so.10` but *without* the specific module name `libcrypto.so.10(libcrypto.so.10)`. Newer packages, especially those compiled against a more recent `openssl` development environment, might explicitly require this module name.

### How to Diagnose

First, let's confirm the problem by inspecting what your currently installed `openssl-libs` package provides.

```bash
# Check what your installed openssl-libs package provides
# For RHEL/CentOS 7+, the library is typically in openssl-libs
rpm -q --provides openssl-libs | grep libcrypto.so.10
```

**Expected Output (Problematic - missing specific module name):**
```
libcrypto.so.10()(64bit)
libcrypto.so.10(OPENSSL_1.0.1)(64bit)
# ... potentially other OPENSSL_ versions, but NOT libcrypto.so.10(libcrypto.so.10)(64bit)
```

**Expected Output (Correct - specific module name present):**
```
libcrypto.so.10()(64bit)
libcrypto.so.10(OPENSSL_1.0.1)(64bit)
libcrypto.so.10(OPENSSL_1.0.1_EC)(64bit)
libcrypto.so.10(libcrypto.so.10)(64bit) # <--- This is the one we're looking for!
```

If your output is missing `libcrypto.so.10(libcrypto.so.10)(64bit)`, then upgrading `openssl-libs` is the correct path.

### Solution: Upgrading `openssl-libs` via Direct RPM Download

The most reliable way to ensure you get the correct version with all necessary module names is to download the latest compatible `openssl-libs` RPM directly from your OS mirror and install it. This bypasses potential YUM repository issues or exclusions.

**Steps:**

1.  **Identify your OS version and architecture:**
    ```bash
    cat /etc/redhat-release
    uname -m
    ```
    This will typically be `CentOS Linux release 7 (Core)` and `x86_64`.

2.  **Find the correct RPM:**
    Navigate to the official CentOS/RHEL mirror for your version.
    For CentOS 7, you'd typically look in:
    `http://mirror.centos.org/centos/7/os/x86_64/Packages/`
    or, for more recent updates:
    `http://mirror.centos.org/centos/7/updates/x86_64/Packages/`

    Search for `openssl-libs` and find the latest version. As of late 2024/early 2025, a common version might be `openssl-libs-1.0.2k-26.el7_9.x86_64.rpm` or similar. **Always verify the exact filename and URL.**

3.  **Download the RPM:**
    ```bash
    # Example for CentOS 7.9.2009 (adjust URL and filename as needed)
    OPENSSL_LIBS_RPM_URL="http://mirror.centos.org/centos/7/updates/x86_64/Packages/openssl-libs-1.0.2k-26.el7_9.x86_64.rpm"
    wget "$OPENSSL_LIBS_RPM_URL" -O openssl-libs.rpm
    ```
    **Pro-tip for finding the latest:** You can often use `curl` and `grep` to find the latest version on a mirror:
    ```bash
    curl -s http://mirror.centos.org/centos/7/updates/x86_64/Packages/ | grep -oP 'openssl-libs-\d+\.\d+\.\d+k-\d+\.el7_\d+\.x86_64\.rpm' | sort -V | tail -n 1
    ```
    Once you have the filename, construct the full URL.

4.  **Install/Upgrade the RPM:**
    Use `rpm -Uvh` to upgrade the package. The `--force` flag can be used if you encounter conflicts, but use it cautiously as it can overwrite files.

    ```bash
    sudo rpm -Uvh openssl-libs.rpm
    # If you encounter dependency conflicts or file conflicts, you might need --force
    # sudo rpm -Uvh openssl-libs.rpm --force
    ```
    The `-Uvh` flag means:
    *   `-U`: Upgrade (install if not present, upgrade if older version is present)
    *   `-v`: Verbose output
    *   `-h`: Hash marks for progress

5.  **Verify the fix:**
    After installation, re-run the `rpm -q --provides` command to confirm the module name is now present.
    ```bash
    rpm -q --provides openssl-libs | grep libcrypto.so.10
    ```
    You should now see `libcrypto.so.10(libcrypto.so.10)(64bit)` in the output.

6.  **Retry your original package installation:**
    ```bash
    sudo yum install your-problematic-package.rpm
    ```

### Example Walkthrough (CentOS 7)

Let's assume you're trying to install `geramer-server.rpm` and it fails with:
`Requires: libcrypto.so.10(libcrypto.so.10)(64bit)`

```bash
# 1. Check current openssl-libs provides
rpm -q --provides openssl-libs | grep libcrypto.so.10
# Output might be:
# libcrypto.so.10()(64bit)
# libcrypto.so.10(OPENSSL_1.0.1)(64bit)
# (Missing the specific libcrypto.so.10(libcrypto.so.10)(64bit) module)

# 2. Find the latest openssl-libs for CentOS 7 (example URL, verify current)
#    Let's say we found openssl-libs-1.0.2k-26.el7_9.x86_64.rpm
OPENSSL_LIBS_URL="http://mirror.centos.org/centos/7/updates/x86_64/Packages/openssl-libs-1.0.2k-26.el7_9.x86_64.rpm"

# 3. Download
wget "$OPENSSL_LIBS_URL" -O openssl-libs-latest.rpm

# 4. Install/Upgrade
sudo rpm -Uvh openssl-libs-latest.rpm
# Output: Preparing...                          ################################# [100%]
#         Updating / installing...
#            1:openssl-libs-1:1.0.2k-26.el7_9.x86_64 ################################# [100%]

# 5. Verify again
rpm -q --provides openssl-libs | grep libcrypto.so.10
# Output should now include:
# libcrypto.so.10()(64bit)
# libcrypto.so.10(OPENSSL_1.0.1)(64bit)
# libcrypto.so.10(OPENSSL_1.0.1_EC)(64bit)
# libcrypto.so.10(libcrypto.so.10)(64bit) # <-- SUCCESS!

# 6. Retry original installation
sudo yum install geramer-server.rpm
# This should now proceed without the libcrypto dependency error.
```

This method is highly effective because it directly addresses the root cause of the module name mismatch by providing a version of `openssl-libs` that explicitly declares the required module.

## Method 2: Upgrading `openssl` for Older Systems (CentOS/RHEL 6)

**Persona:** 📚 Learning Explorer, 🔧 Problem Solver, ⚡ Legacy Maintainer

Similar to Method 1, older CentOS/RHEL 6 systems might experience the same dependency resolution failure, but the package providing `libcrypto.so.10` is typically named `openssl` rather than `openssl-libs`. The underlying problem remains the same: the installed `openssl` package provides the library file but lacks the specific module name `libcrypto.so.10(libcrypto.so.10)(64bit)` that a newer application's RPM requires.

### How to Diagnose (CentOS/RHEL 6)

First, confirm what your currently installed `openssl` package provides.

```bash
# Check what your installed openssl package provides
# For RHEL/CentOS 6, the library is typically in openssl
rpm -q --provides openssl | grep libcrypto.so.10
```

If the output is missing `libcrypto.so.10(libcrypto.so.10)(64bit)`, then upgrading `openssl` is the solution.

### Solution: Upgrading `openssl` via Direct RPM Download

Just like with CentOS 7, the most reliable fix is to download and install a compatible `openssl` RPM directly from your OS mirror.

**Steps:**

1.  **Identify your OS version and architecture:**
    ```bash
    cat /etc/redhat-release
    uname -m
    ```
    This will typically be `CentOS release 6.x (Final)` and `x86_64`.

2.  **Find the correct RPM:**
    Navigate to the official CentOS/RHEL mirror for your version.
    For CentOS 6, you'd typically look in:
    `http://mirror.centos.org/centos/6/os/x86_64/Packages/`
    or, for more recent updates:
    `http://mirror.centos.org/centos/6/updates/x86_64/Packages/`

    Search for `openssl` and find the latest version. As of late 2024/early 2025, a common version might be `openssl-1.0.1e-60.el6_10.x86_64.rpm` or similar. **Always verify the exact filename and URL.**

3.  **Download the RPM:**
    ```bash
    # Example for CentOS 6.10 (adjust URL and filename as needed)
    OPENSSL_RPM_URL="http://mirror.centos.org/centos/6/updates/x86_64/Packages/openssl-1.0.1e-60.el6_10.x86_64.rpm"
    wget "$OPENSSL_RPM_URL" -O openssl.rpm
    ```
    **Pro-tip for finding the latest:**
    ```bash
    curl -s http://mirror.centos.org/centos/6/updates/x86_64/Packages/ | grep -oP 'openssl-\d+\.\d+\.\d+e-\d+\.el6_\d+\.x86_64\.rpm' | sort -V | tail -n 1
    ```
    Once you have the filename, construct the full URL.

4.  **Install/Upgrade the RPM:**
    Use `rpm -Uvh` to upgrade the package. The `--force` flag can be used if you encounter conflicts, but use it cautiously.

    ```bash
    sudo rpm -Uvh openssl.rpm
    # If you encounter dependency conflicts or file conflicts, you might need --force
    # sudo rpm -Uvh openssl.rpm --force
    ```

5.  **Verify the fix:**
    After installation, re-run the `rpm -q --provides` command to confirm the module name is now present.
    ```bash
    rpm -q --provides openssl | grep libcrypto.so.10
    ```
    You should now see `libcrypto.so.10(libcrypto.so.10)(64bit)` in the output.

6.  **Retry your original package installation:**
    ```bash
    sudo yum install your-problematic-package.rpm
    ```

### Example Walkthrough (CentOS 6)

Let's assume you're trying to install `postgresql91.rpm` and it fails with:
`Requires: libcrypto.so.10(libcrypto.so.10)(64bit)` and `libssl.so.10(libssl.so.10)(64bit)`

```bash
# 1. Check current openssl provides
rpm -q --provides openssl | grep libcrypto.so.10
rpm -q --provides openssl | grep libssl.so.10
# Output might be:
# libcrypto.so.10()(64bit)
# libssl.so.10()(64bit)
# (Missing the specific module names)

# 2. Find the latest openssl for CentOS 6 (example URL, verify current)
#    Let's say we found openssl-1.0.1e-60.el6_10.x86_64.rpm
OPENSSL_URL="http://mirror.centos.org/centos/6/updates/x86_64/Packages/openssl-1.0.1e-60.el6_10.x86_64.rpm"

# 3. Download
wget "$OPENSSL_URL" -O openssl-latest.rpm

# 4. Install/Upgrade
sudo rpm -Uvh openssl-latest.rpm
# Output: Preparing...                          ################################# [100%]
#         Updating / installing...
#            1:openssl-1:1.0.1e-60.el6_10.x86_64 ################################# [100%]

# 5. Verify again
rpm -q --provides openssl | grep libcrypto.so.10
rpm -q --provides openssl | grep libssl.so.10

```

This method is crucial for maintaining compatibility on older, but still supported, RHEL/CentOS 6 systems when installing newer software that expects specific `openssl` module declarations.

## Method 3: Checking and Modifying YUM Exclusions

**Persona:** ⚡ Legacy Maintainer, 🏗️ Architecture Builder, 🔧 Problem Solver

In managed environments, or on systems where administrators want to prevent accidental upgrades of critical packages, `yum` (or `dnf` on newer systems) can be configured to exclude certain packages from updates or installations. If `openssl` or `openssl-libs` is on this exclusion list, `yum` will refuse to upgrade it, leading to the dependency resolution failure even if a newer version is available in the repositories.

### How to Diagnose

The `exclude` directive is typically found in `/etc/yum.conf` or in `.repo` files within `/etc/yum.repos.d/`.

1.  **Check `/etc/yum.conf`:**
    ```bash
    grep "^exclude=" /etc/yum.conf
    ```
    Look for `openssl*` or `openssl-libs*` in the output.

    **Example output:**
    ```
    exclude=kernel* openssl* httpd*
    ```
    In this case, `openssl*` is excluded.

2.  **Check `.repo` files:**
    It's less common for `openssl` to be excluded in individual repo files, but it's worth checking if `/etc/yum.conf` doesn't show an exclusion.
    ```bash
    grep -r "exclude=" /etc/yum.repos.d/
    ```

### Solution: Removing `openssl` from YUM Exclusions

If you find `openssl*` or `openssl-libs*` in the `exclude` list, you'll need to remove it.

**Steps:**

1.  **Backup `yum.conf`:**
    Always back up configuration files before modifying them.
    ```bash
    sudo cp /etc/yum.conf /etc/yum.conf.bak_$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S)
    ```

2.  **Edit `yum.conf`:**
    Open `/etc/yum.conf` with a text editor (e.g., `vi`, `nano`).
    ```bash
    sudo vi /etc/yum.conf
    ```
    Locate the `exclude=` line.

    **Before:**
    ```ini
    [main]
    cachedir=/var/cache/yum/$basearch/$releasever
    keepcache=0
    debuglevel=2
    logfile=/var/log/yum.log
    exactarch=1
    obsoletes=1
    gpgcheck=1
    plugins=1
    installonly_limit=5
    bugtracker_url=http://bugs.centos.org/set_project.php?project_id=23&ref=http://bugs.centos.org/bug_report_page.php?category=yum
    distroverpkg=centos-release
    exclude=kernel* openssl* # <--- Remove openssl* from here
    ```

    **After:**
    ```ini
    [main]
    # ... (other settings) ...
    exclude=kernel* # openssl* removed
    ```
    Save and close the file.

3.  **Clean YUM cache:**
    ```bash
    sudo yum clean all
    ```

4.  **Attempt to update/install `openssl-libs` (or `openssl`):**
    Now that it's no longer excluded, `yum` should be able to see and process updates for these packages.
    ```bash
    sudo yum update openssl-libs openssl
    ```
    This command will attempt to update both packages. If only one is relevant to your system (e.g., `openssl-libs` for CentOS 7, `openssl` for CentOS 6), `yum` will handle it gracefully.

5.  **Retry your original package installation:**
    ```bash
    sudo yum install your-problematic-package.rpm
    ```

### Example Scenario

Imagine a system administrator has a policy to pin `openssl` to a specific version for compliance reasons, so they added `openssl*` to the `exclude` list. A new application requires a newer `openssl` that provides the `libcrypto.so.10(libcrypto.so.10)(64bit)` module.

```bash
# Initial check
grep "^exclude=" /etc/yum.conf
# Output: exclude=kernel* openssl*

# Attempt to install new package
sudo yum install new-app.rpm
# Error: Requires: libcrypto.so.10(libcrypto.so.10)(64bit)

# Edit /etc/yum.conf (using vi)
# Change 'exclude=kernel* openssl*' to 'exclude=kernel*'

# Clean yum cache
sudo yum clean all

# Update openssl-libs (assuming CentOS 7)
sudo yum update openssl-libs
# This should now find and install the latest openssl-libs.

# Retry new app installation
sudo yum install new-app.rpm
# Success!
```

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Security Implications:** Removing `openssl` from exclusions means it will be updated. While this often fixes dependency issues, ensure you understand the security implications of updating core system libraries in your environment.
*   **Re-add Exclusion:** If the exclusion was temporary, remember to re-add `openssl*` to `/etc/yum.conf` after your installation is complete and verified, if that's your organization's policy.
*   **Alternative:** Instead of removing the exclusion globally, you can temporarily disable it for a single `yum` command using the `--disableexcludes` option:
    ```bash
    sudo yum --disableexcludes=main update openssl-libs
    sudo yum --disableexcludes=main install your-problematic-package.rpm
    ```
    This is a safer approach for temporary overrides.

## Method 4: Installing `openssl` and `openssl-libs` Simultaneously

**Persona:** 🔧 Problem Solver, 🏗️ Architecture Builder

Sometimes, `openssl` and `openssl-libs` can have circular dependencies or complex interdependencies, especially when dealing with specific versions or third-party repositories. Attempting to install one might fail because it requires a newer version of the other, which itself might be blocked. Installing both packages in a single `yum install` command, specifying their direct RPM URLs, can sometimes resolve these intricate dependency loops by allowing `yum` to process them together.

This method is particularly useful when `yum` struggles to resolve dependencies from its configured repositories, or when you're trying to install specific versions of `openssl` and `openssl-libs` that are known to be compatible.

### How it Works

When you provide multiple RPM URLs to `yum install`, `yum` attempts to download and resolve dependencies for all specified packages in one go. This can help it find a consistent set of packages that satisfy all requirements, even if individual installations would fail due to temporary dependency mismatches.

### Solution: Simultaneous Installation via Direct RPM URLs

**Steps:**

1.  **Identify your OS version and architecture:**
    ```bash
    cat /etc/redhat-release
    uname -m
    ```

2.  **Find the correct `openssl` and `openssl-libs` RPMs:**
    This is the most critical step. You need to find a *compatible pair* of `openssl` and `openssl-libs` RPMs for your specific OS version (e.g., CentOS 7). They should ideally be from the same release or update stream to ensure they work together.

    Navigate to the official CentOS/RHEL mirror for your version.
    For CentOS 7, you'd typically look in:
    `http://mirror.centos.org/centos/7/os/x86_64/Packages/`
    or, for more recent updates:
    `http://mirror.centos.org/centos/7/updates/x86_64/Packages/`

    Search for `openssl` and `openssl-libs` and identify versions that match (e.g., `openssl-1.0.2k-26.el7_9.x86_64.rpm` and `openssl-libs-1.0.2k-26.el7_9.x86_64.rpm`).

    **Example of finding URLs (adjust for your OS and latest versions):**
    ```bash
    # For CentOS 7, finding a matching pair (example versions)
    OPENSSL_RPM_URL="http://mirror.centos.org/centos/7/updates/x86_64/Packages/openssl-1.0.2k-26.el7_9.x86_64.rpm"
    OPENSSL_LIBS_RPM_URL="http://mirror.centos.org/centos/7/updates/x86_64/Packages/openssl-libs-1.0.2k-26.el7_9.x86_64.rpm"
    ```
    **Important:** Ensure the versions are consistent. Mismatched versions can lead to new problems.

3.  **Execute the simultaneous installation:**
    ```bash
    sudo yum install "$OPENSSL_RPM_URL" "$OPENSSL_LIBS_RPM_URL"
    ```
    `yum` will download both packages and attempt to resolve their dependencies together. If they are compatible and provide the necessary module names, this should succeed.

4.  **Retry your original package installation:**
    ```bash
    sudo yum install your-problematic-package.rpm
    ```

### Example Scenario (CentOS 7)

Let's say you're on CentOS 7, and you've tried updating `openssl-libs` alone, but it still fails because `openssl` itself is also outdated and causing issues, or vice-versa.

```bash
# 1. Identify current OS and find compatible openssl and openssl-libs RPMs.
#    Let's assume we've found these specific versions for CentOS 7:
OPENSSL_RPM_URL="http://mirror.centos.org/centos/7/updates/x86_64/Packages/openssl-1.0.2k-26.el7_9.x86_64.rpm"
OPENSSL_LIBS_RPM_URL="http://mirror.centos.org/centos/7/updates/x86_64/Packages/openssl-libs-1.0.2k-26.el7_9.x86_64.rpm"

# 2. Install both simultaneously
echo "Attempting to install openssl and openssl-libs simultaneously..."
sudo yum install "$OPENSSL_RPM_URL" "$OPENSSL_LIBS_RPM_URL"

# Expected output (example):

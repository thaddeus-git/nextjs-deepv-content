# Lightweight Graph Databases for Prototyping

## Quick Answer

For lightweight graph database prototyping, **TinkerGraph** (part of Apache TinkerPop) is highly recommended for its in-memory operation and integration with Gremlin. If Cypher is a strict requirement, **Memgraph** offers an in-memory solution with Cypher support, while **RedisGraph** (though now deprecated) was another option for Cypher users leveraging Redis.

## Choose Your Method

Deciding on a lightweight graph database for prototyping often depends on your preferred query language, environment, and specific needs.

    C -- No --> E[Consider Neo4j (if weight is acceptable)];
    B -- No --> F{Prefer Gremlin/TinkerPop?};
    F -- Yes --> G[Use TinkerGraph with Gremlin REPL];
    F -- No --> H{Working with Python?};

## Ready-to-Use Code

While direct code for setting up a full graph database is extensive, here are snippets demonstrating interaction with recommended options.

### TinkerGraph (Gremlin Console)

TinkerGraph is typically used with the Gremlin Console for interactive prototyping.

```groovy
// Start Gremlin Console
gremlin> graph = TinkerFactory.createModern(); // Create a sample graph
gremlin> g = graph.traversal(); // Get a traversal source
gremlin> g.V().has('name', 'marko').out('knows').values('name'); // Query
==>vadas
==>josh
```

### Memgraph (Python Client)

Memgraph offers a Python client for Cypher queries.

```python
import mgclient

# Connect to Memgraph
conn = mgclient.connect(host='localhost', port=7687)
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Create nodes and relationships
cursor.execute("CREATE (p:Person {name: 'Alice'})-[:KNOWS]->(q:Person {name: 'Bob'})")
conn.commit()

# Query data
cursor.execute("MATCH (p:Person)-[:KNOWS]->(q:Person) RETURN p.name, q.name")
for row in cursor:
    print(f"{row[0]} knows {row[1]}")

cursor.close()
conn.close()
```

## Method 1: TinkerGraph with Gremlin

**TinkerGraph**, part of the Apache TinkerPop stack, is an excellent choice for lightweight, in-memory graph prototyping. It's designed to be fast and trivial to use, operating entirely in memory.

### Key Features:
*   **In-Memory**: All data resides in RAM, making it extremely fast for prototyping and testing.
*   **Gremlin Integration**: Fully integrated with the Gremlin graph traversal language and REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop), providing an interactive workbench for graph exploration.
*   **Blueprints API**: Implements the Blueprints API (TinkerPop 2.x) and later the TinkerPop 3.x interfaces, allowing for consistent interaction across different graph databases.
*   **Language Agnostic**: While the core is JVM-based, TinkerPop provides client drivers for various languages (Python, JavaScript, Go, etc.) to connect to a Gremlin Server, which can host TinkerGraph.

### Usage Example (Gremlin Console):

1.  **Download and run the Gremlin Console.**
2.  **Start an in-memory graph:**
    ```groovy
    gremlin> graph = TinkerGraph.open()
    ==>tinkergraph[vertices:0 edges:0]
    gremlin> g = graph.traversal()
    ==>graphtraversal[tinkergraph[vertices:0 edges:0], standard]
    ```
3.  **Add data:**
    ```groovy
    gremlin> marko = g.addV('person').property('name', 'marko').next()
    ==>v[0]
    gremlin> vadas = g.addV('person').property('name', 'vadas').next()
    ==>v[1]
    gremlin> marko.addEdge('knows', vadas, 'weight', 0.5)
    ==>e[2][0-knows->1]
    ```
4.  **Query data:**
    ```groovy
    gremlin> g.V(marko).out('knows').values('name')
    ==>vadas
    ```

### Considerations:
*   **JVM Dependency**: The core TinkerGraph and Gremlin Console are JVM-based. While clients exist for other languages, direct embedding might involve JVM.
*   **Gremlin Query Language**: Requires learning Gremlin, which is a powerful but different paradigm than Cypher.

## Method 2: Memgraph for Cypher Prototyping

If your prototyping specifically requires the **Cypher query language** and an in-memory solution, **Memgraph** is a strong contender.

### Key Features:
*   **In-Memory**: Designed for high-performance, real-time graph analytics by keeping data in RAM.
*   **Cypher Support**: Fully supports the Cypher query language, making it familiar for those coming from Neo4j or similar environments.
*   **Docker Deployment**: Easily deployable via Docker, simplifying setup for prototyping.
*   **Client Libraries**: Offers client libraries for various languages, including Python, C#, Java, and Node.js.

### Usage Example (Docker & Python):

1.  **Run Memgraph via Docker:**
    ```bash
    docker run -it -p 7687:7687 memgraph/memgraph-platform
    ```
2.  **Connect and query with Python (using `mgclient`):**
    ```python
    import mgclient

    # Connect to Memgraph
    conn = mgclient.connect(host='localhost', port=7687)
    cursor = conn.cursor()

    # Create a simple graph
    cursor.execute("CREATE (a:User {name: 'John'})-[:FOLLOWS]->(b:User {name: 'Jane'})")
    conn.commit()

    # Query the graph
    cursor.execute("MATCH (u:User)-[:FOLLOWS]->(f:User) RETURN u.name, f.name")
    for row in cursor:
        print(f"{row[0]} follows {row[1]}")

    cursor.close()
    conn.close()
    ```

### Considerations:
*   **Resource Usage**: While in-memory, it can consume significant RAM for larger datasets, even in prototyping.
*   **Community Edition**: The free version has certain limitations compared to enterprise offerings.

## Method 3: RedisGraph (Historical Context)

**RedisGraph** was an in-memory graph database module for Redis that supported Cypher. While it was a popular choice for lightweight Cypher prototyping, it has been **deprecated** as of July 2023.

### Key Features (Historical):
*   **Redis Integration**: Leveraged Redis's in-memory data store for speed.
*   **Cypher Query Language**: Allowed users to query graphs using Cypher.
*   **GraphBLAS**: Utilized GraphBLAS (Graph Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) for efficient graph operations.

### Why it was relevant for prototyping:
*   **Extremely Lightweight**: As a Redis module, it was very easy to set up and run alongside an existing Redis instance.
*   **Familiarity**: For Redis users, it offered a natural extension for graph capabilities.

### Current Status:
*   **Deprecated**: RedisGraph is no longer actively developed or supported by Redis Labs. Existing deployments might still function, but new projects should avoid it.

## Method 4: NetworkX (Python Specific)

For Python developers, **NetworkX** is a powerful library for the creation, manipulation, and study of the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks. While not a "database" in the traditional sense, it's an excellent in-memory graph library for prototyping and analysis.

### Key Features:
*   **Pure Python**: No external database server required; graphs are Python objects.
*   **Rich API**: Extensive functions for graph creation, modification, algorithms (shortest path, centrality, etc.).
*   **Visualization**: Integrates well with Matplotlib for basic graph visualization.
*   **Data Structures**: Supports various graph types (directed, undirected, multigraphs).

### Usage Example:

```python
import networkx as nx
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create an empty graph
G = nx.Graph()

# Add nodes
G.add_node("Alice")
G.add_node("Bob")
G.add_node("Charlie")

# Add edges (relationships)
G.add_edge("Alice", "Bob", relationship="friends")
G.add_edge("Bob", "Charlie", relationship="colleagues")

# Querying (example: neighbors)
print(f"Neighbors of Bob: {list(G.neighbors('Bob'))}")

# Basic visualization
nx.draw(G, with_labels=True, node_color='lightblue', font_weight='bold')
plt.show()
```

### Considerations:
*   **Not a Database**: Data is lost when the program ends unless explicitly saved to a file (e.g., GML, JSON).
*   **Scalability**: Primarily for in-memory analysis; not designed for persistent storage or large-scale distributed graphs.
*   **Query Language**: Uses Python code for graph traversal and manipulation, not a dedicated graph query language like Cypher or Gremlin.

## Common Problems & Solutions

### 1. JVM Overhead (TinkerGraph)
*   **Problem**: The core TinkerGraph and Gremlin Console are JVM-based, which can feel heavy for non-JVM environments.
*   **Solution**:
    *   **Use Gremlin Server**: Run TinkerGraph on a Gremlin Server (JVM) and connect to it from your preferred language using a Gremlin client library (e.g., `gremlinpython` for Python, `gremlin-javascript` for Node.js). This separates the JVM process from your application.
    *   **Consider Alternatives**: If JVM is a strict no-go, options like NetworkX (Python) or language-specific graph libraries might be more suitable, though they might lack a universal query language like Gremlin.

### 2. Data Persistence (In-Memory Databases)
*   **Problem**: In-memory databases like TinkerGraph and Memgraph lose all data when the process stops (unless configured for persistence, which adds complexity).
*   **Solution**:
    *   **Export/Import**: For prototyping, regularly export your graph data to a file format (e.g., GraphML, CSV) and import it when restarting.
    *   **Snapshotting**: Some in-memory databases offer snapshotting features to periodically save the state to disk.
    *   **Use for Ephemeral Data**: Embrace their nature for prototyping where data is temporary or easily re-generated. For production, consider persistent graph databases.

### 3. Cypher vs. Gremlin Learning Curve
*   **Problem**: The choice between Cypher and Gremlin can be a learning hurdle.
*   **Solution**:
    *   **Align with Team Skills**: If your team is already familiar with one, prioritize that.
    *   **Transpilers**: Tools like `Cypher for Gremlin` (a transpiler) can convert Cypher queries to Gremlin, allowing you to use Cypher with TinkerPop-compatible databases. This can be a bridge solution.
    *   **Evaluate Use Case**: Gremlin is often more programmatic and flexible for complex traversals, while Cypher is more declarative and SQL-like.

## Summary

Choosing a lightweight graph database for prototyping involves balancing ease of use, query language preference, and environmental constraints.

*   **For Gremlin users or general graph exploration**: **TinkerGraph** (with Gremlin Console/Server) is the go-to for its speed and flexibility.
*   **For Cypher users needing in-memory performance**: **Memgraph** is a modern and powerful option.
*   **For Python-centric analysis without a full database**: **NetworkX** provides robust in-memory graph manipulation capabilities.
*   **Historical Note**: **RedisGraph** was a viable Cypher option but is now deprecated.

Each option offers unique advantages, allowing developers to quickly model and query graph data without the overhead of a full-fledged production graph database.

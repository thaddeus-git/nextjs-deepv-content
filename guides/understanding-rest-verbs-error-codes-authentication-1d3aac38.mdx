# Understanding REST: Verbs, Error Codes, and Authentication

REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for networked applications. It leverages standard HTTP methods to perform operations on resources, aiming for simplicity, scalability, and statelessness. This guide clarifies common questions about designing RESTful APIs, including proper use of HTTP verbs, handling custom actions, managing error responses, and implementing authentication.

## Quick Answer

A RESTful API uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to operate on resources identified by URIs. For custom actions, consider re-evaluating your resource design or using sub-resources. Error messages should leverage standard HTTP status codes (4xx for client errors, 5xx for server errors) with detailed information in the response body. Authentication typically involves stateless mechanisms like API keys or token-based systems (e.g., OAuth), avoiding server-side sessions.

## Concept Explanation

REST is built on several core principles:

1.  **Client-Server Architecture**: Separation of concerns between client and server.
2.  **Statelessness**: Each request from client to server must contain all the information needed to understand the request. The server should not store any client context between requests.
3.  **Cacheability**: Responses must explicitly or implicitly define themselves as cacheable or non-cacheable to prevent clients from reusing stale or inappropriate data.
4.  **Uniform Interface**: This is the most crucial constraint, simplifying the overall system architecture. It includes:
    *   **Resource Identification in Requests**: Resources are identified by URIs.
    *   **Resource Manipulation through Representations**: Clients interact with resources by exchanging representations (e.g., JSON, XML).
    *   **Self-Descriptive Messages**: Each message includes enough information to describe how to process the message.
    *   **Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State (HATEOAS)**: Clients transition application state by selecting links within representations.

## Working with HTTP Verbs and Resources

The foundation of REST lies in mapping standard HTTP methods to CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources.

### Standard CRUD Operations

Your initial understanding of mapping HTTP verbs to resource operations is largely correct:

*   **`GET /api/users`**: Lists all users.
*   **`POST /api/users`**: Creates a new user. The server assigns the ID and returns a `201 Created` status with the new resource's URI in the `Location` header.
*   **`GET /api/users/1`**: Retrieves the user with ID 1.
*   **`PUT /api/users/1`**: Updates the user with ID 1. This method is idempotent, meaning multiple identical requests have the same effect as a single one. It typically replaces the entire resource.
*   **`DELETE /api/users/1`**: Deletes the user with ID 1.

### Handling Custom Actions (More Verbs)

When you feel the need for "more verbs" like `activate_login` or `change_password`, it often indicates that your resources might need to be re-identified or modeled differently. REST encourages thinking in terms of nouns (resources) rather than verbs (actions).

Here's how to express common custom actions in a RESTful way:

#### 1. **Modeling Actions as Sub-Resources**

Instead of a verb in the URL, treat the *state* or *outcome* of the action as a resource.

*   **Activate/Deactivate Login**:
    *   Consider "session" as a resource. To create a new session (login), `POST` to `/api/sessions` with credentials. To end a session (logout), `DELETE` to `/api/sessions/{session_id}`.
    *   Alternatively, for a user's login status, you could have a sub-resource representing the "active" state:
        *   To activate: `PUT /api/users/1/login/active` with a body indicating `true`.
        *   To deactivate: `PUT /api/users/1/login/active` with a body indicating `false`.
        *   Or, `POST /api/users/1/activation` to activate, and `DELETE /api/users/1/activation` to deactivate.

#### 2. **Updating Resource Properties**

Actions like `change_password` are essentially updates to a user resource.

*   **Change Password**: `PUT /api/users/1` with the new password (and possibly old password for verification) in the request body. Some argue for `PATCH` if only a partial update is intended, or `PUT /api/users/1/password` to update a specific sub-resource.

#### 3. **Adding to a Collection**

Actions like `add_credit` can be modeled as adding an item to a collection.

*   **Add Credit**: `POST /api/users/1/credits` with a body containing the credit details (e.g., amount). This creates a new credit transaction for the user.

**Key Principle**: `GET` requests should *never* have side effects. They are for retrieving data only and should be cacheable. Using `GET` for `activate_login` would violate this core principle.

## Error Handling and Status Codes

REST leverages standard HTTP status codes to convey the outcome of a request.

### Standard HTTP Status Codes

*   **2xx (Success)**: The request was successfully received, understood, and accepted.
    *   `200 OK`: General success.
    *   `201 Created`: Resource successfully created (e.g., after a `POST`).
    *   `204 No Content`: Request successful, but no content to return (e.g., after a `DELETE`).
*   **3xx (Redirection)**: Further action needs to be taken by the user agent to fulfill the request.
*   **4xx (Client Error)**: The client appears to have erred.
    *   `400 Bad Request`: The server cannot process the request due to a client error (e.g., malformed syntax).
    *   `401 Unauthorized`: Authentication is required and has failed or has not yet been provided.
    *   `403 Forbidden`: The server understood the request but refuses to authorize it.
    *   `404 Not Found`: The requested resource could not be found.
    *   `405 Method Not Allowed`: The method specified in the request line is not allowed for the resource identified by the Request-URI.
    *   `409 Conflict`: Indicates that the request could not be processed because of conflict in the current state of the resource.
    *   `422 Unprocessable Entity`: The server understands the content type of the request entity, and the syntax of the request entity is correct, but it was unable to process the contained instructions. (Often used for validation errors).
*   **5xx (Server Error)**: The server failed to fulfill an apparently valid request.
    *   `500 Internal Server Error`: A generic error message, given when an unexpected condition was encountered.
    *   `503 Service Unavailable`: The server is currently unable to handle the request due to a temporary overload or scheduled maintenance.

### Returning Detailed Error Messages

For detailed error descriptions, use the response body. The body can contain a structured format (e.g., JSON or XML) with proprietary error codes, human-readable messages, and possibly links to documentation.

```json
{
  "code": "DB_CONN_FAILED",
  "message": "Failed to connect to the database. Please try again later.",
  "details": "Connection timed out after 30 seconds."
}
```

Or for validation errors:

```json
{
  "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
  "message": "One or more fields are invalid.",
  "errors": [
    {
      "field": "email",
      "message": "Email format is invalid."
    },
    {
      "field": "password",
      "message": "Password must be at least 8 characters long."
    }
  ]
}
```

**Custom Headers for Errors**: While you can use custom headers like `X-Status-Extended` for specific error codes, it's generally recommended to keep detailed error information in the body. This allows for richer, more structured error responses that are easier for clients to parse and display. Standard HTTP headers are primarily for metadata about the request/response itself, not application-specific error details.

## Authentication in RESTful APIs

REST APIs are inherently stateless, meaning the server does not store session information about the client between requests. This has significant implications for authentication.

### Recommended Approaches

1.  **API Keys**: A simple approach where a unique key is provided with each request, typically in a header (e.g., `X-API-Key`) or as a query parameter (less secure as it can be logged). The server validates the key against its stored list.
    *   **Pros**: Simple to implement.
    *   **Cons**: Requires secure transmission (HTTPS), key management (revocation, rotation).

2.  **Token-Based Authentication (e.g., OAuth 2.0, JWT)**:
    *   The client sends credentials (username/password) to an authentication endpoint.
    *   The server validates credentials and returns an access token (e.g., a JWT - JSON Web Token).
    *   The client then includes this token in the `Authorization` header of subsequent requests (e.g., `Authorization: Bearer <token>`).
    *   The server validates the token on each request. JWTs are self-contained and can be validated without a database lookup, enhancing scalability.
    *   **Pros**: Stateless, scalable, supports different grant types (e.g., client credentials, authorization code flow), widely adopted.
    *   **Cons**: More complex to implement initially, token expiration and refresh mechanisms need careful design.

3.  **HTTP Authentication (Basic/Digest)**:
    *   **Basic Authentication**: Sends username and password (Base64 encoded) in the `Authorization` header with every request.
        *   **Pros**: Very simple.
        *   **Cons**: Credentials are sent with every request (even if encoded, they are easily decoded), requiring HTTPS for security. Not suitable for web browsers due to poor UX.
    *   **Digest Authentication**: More secure than Basic, involves a challenge-response mechanism.
        *   **Pros**: Credentials are not sent directly.
        *   **Cons**: More complex, less widely adopted than token-based systems for APIs.

### Why Avoid Sessions?

Using server-side sessions for REST authentication violates the stateless principle. It ties a client to a specific server instance (making horizontal scaling difficult) and introduces state that needs to be managed. While it might integrate easily with existing infrastructure, it undermines the benefits of a truly RESTful architecture.

## Summary

Designing a truly RESTful API involves more than just using HTTP verbs. It requires careful consideration of resources, their representations, and how state transitions are driven by hypermedia. By adhering to REST principles, especially statelessness and the uniform interface, you can build scalable, maintainable, and interoperable web services. When faced with "more verbs," always try to re-evaluate your resource model. For errors, leverage standard HTTP status codes and provide detailed information in the response body. For authentication, embrace stateless token-based mechanisms.

## Image Generation Prompts

**PLACEHOLDER-1:** A clear, clean diagram illustrating the mapping of HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to CRUD operations on a "User" resource. Show `/api/users` for collection operations (GET list, POST create) and `/api/users/{id}` for member operations (GET retrieve, PUT update, DELETE delete). Use distinct colors for each verb and an arrow pointing from the verb to the corresponding action. The diagram should be simple and easy to understand.

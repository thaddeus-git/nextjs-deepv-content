# Test Article for Workflow Validation

This is a test article created to verify that the validation and promotion workflow is working correctly.

## Purpose

This article tests:
- Filename validation (follows pattern)
- Frontmatter validation (all required fields)
- Content promotion from staging to production
- Git commit and push workflow

## Content

This article has sufficient content to pass the minimum length validation check.

```javascript
// Test code block
console.log("Workflow test successful!");
```

The validation should pass, and this article should be promoted from staging to production.

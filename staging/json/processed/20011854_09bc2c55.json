For example, if your row number is in `Sheet2!A1` and you want to pull data from `Sheet1!A[row_number]`, use:\n\n```excel\n=INDIRECT(\"Sheet1!A\"&$A$1)\n```\n\nThis formula constructs the cell reference as a text string and then converts it into an actual reference.\n\n## Choose Your Method\n\nDeciding which Excel function to use for dynamic cell referencing depends on your specific needs, especially regarding performance and flexibility.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Start: Need dynamic cell reference?] --> B{Row number in a cell?};\n    B -- Yes --> C{Performance critical or large dataset?};\n    C -- Yes --> D[Use INDEX/MATCH];\n    C -- No --> E[Use INDIRECT];\n    D --> F[Pros: Non-volatile, better performance];\n    D --> G[Cons: More complex for simple row/column changes];\n    E --> H[Pros: Simpler syntax for direct cell construction];\n    E --> I[Cons: Volatile function, can slow down large workbooks];\n    B -- No --> J[Consider other lookup functions like VLOOKUP/HLOOKUP or XLOOKUP];\n    J --> K[End];\n    F --> K;\n    G --> K;\n    H --> K;\n    I --> K;\n```\n![Dynamic Cell Reference Decision Tree](/images/09bc2c55-1.webp)\n\n## Ready-to-Use Code\n\nHere are the most common and effective formulas for dynamic cell referencing based on a row number.\n\n### Using INDIRECT Function\n\nThis method is straightforward for constructing cell references from text.\n\n**Scenario:** You have a row number in `Sheet2!A1`. You want to retrieve data from `Sheet1` based on this row number.\n\n**Formula for `Sheet2!A2` (to get `Sheet1!A[row_number]`):**\n\n```excel\n=INDIRECT(\"Sheet1!A\"&$A$1)\n```\n\n**Formula for `Sheet2!B2` (to get `Sheet1!B[row_number]`):**\n\n```excel\n=INDIRECT(\"Sheet1!B\"&$A$1)\n```\n\nYou can drag these formulas across and down, adjusting the column letter as needed.\n\n### Using INDEX/MATCH (More Robust)\n\nWhile `INDIRECT` is simple, `INDEX/MATCH` is generally preferred for larger datasets because `INDIRECT` is a volatile function, meaning it recalculates every time any cell in the workbook changes, which can impact performance.\n\n**Scenario:** Same as above, row number in `Sheet2!A1`.\n\n**Formula for `Sheet2!A2` (to get `Sheet1!A[row_number]`):**\n\n```excel\n=INDEX(Sheet1!A:A, $A$1)\n```\n\n**Formula for `Sheet2!B2` (to get `Sheet1!B[row_number]`):**\n\n```excel\n=INDEX(Sheet1!B:B, $A$1)\n```\n\nThis formula uses `INDEX` to return the value from a specified row within a given column range.\n\n## Method 1: Using the INDIRECT Function\n\nThe `INDIRECT` function is designed to convert a text string into a valid cell reference. This makes it ideal for situations where you need to build a cell address dynamically.\n\n### How it Works\n\n1.  **Construct the Address:** You combine the sheet name, column letter, and the dynamic row number (from `Sheet2!A1`) into a single text string.\n2.  **`INDIRECT` Evaluates:** The `INDIRECT` function then takes this text string (e.g., \"Sheet1!A101\") and treats it as an actual cell reference, returning the value from that cell.\n\n### Step-by-Step Implementation\n\nLet's assume:\n*   Your source data is in `Sheet1`.\n*   The row number you want to reference is in `Sheet2!A1`.\n*   You want to display the data in `Sheet2` starting from cell `A2`.\n\n**1. Set up the Row Number Input:**\n   In `Sheet2!A1`, enter the row number you wish to retrieve (e.g., `101`).\n\n**2. Enter the Formula for the First Cell (`Sheet2!A2`):**\n   To get the value from `Sheet1!A[row_number]`, enter this in `Sheet2!A2`:\n\n   ```excel\n   =INDIRECT(\"Sheet1!A\"&$A$1)\n   ```\n   *   `\"Sheet1!A\"`: This is the static part of your reference, specifying the sheet and column.\n   *   `&`: This concatenates the text string with the dynamic part.\n   *   `$A$1`: This refers to the cell containing your row number. The `$` signs make it an absolute reference, so it doesn't change when you drag the formula.\n\n**3. Extend to Other Columns:**\n   For `Sheet2!B2` (to get `Sheet1!B[row_number]`):\n\n   ```excel\n   =INDIRECT(\"Sheet1!B\"&$A$1)\n   ```\n\n   For `Sheet2!C2` (to get `Sheet1!C[row_number]`):\n\n   ```excel\n   =INDIRECT(\"Sheet1!C\"&$A$1)\n   ```\n\n   And so on. You will manually change the column letter (`A`, `B`, `C`, etc.) in the formula for each corresponding cell in `Sheet2`.\n\n**4. Extend to Other Rows (if your output spans multiple rows):**\n   If your output in `Sheet2` also spans multiple rows (as in the original question's `fig 2` and `fig 3`), you would continue to build the `INDIRECT` formulas for each cell, adjusting both the column letter and potentially adding an offset to the row number if you need to reference subsequent rows in `Sheet1`.\n\n   For example, if `Sheet2!A3` needs to pull from `Sheet1!E[row_number]`:\n\n   ```excel\n   =INDIRECT(\"Sheet1!E\"&$A$1)\n   ```\n\n### Example Walkthrough\n\nLet's use the example from the question:\n\n**Sheet1 Data (starting at row 101):**\n\n| A   | B   | C   | D   | E   | F   | G   | H   |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Dep | 700 | Sta | 100 | Sta | 300 | Dep | 900 |\n\n**Sheet2 Setup:**\n\n|     | A           | B   | C   | D   |\n| --- | ----------- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1   | 101         |     |     |     |\n| 2   | `=INDIRECT(\"Sheet1!A\"&$A$1)` | `=INDIRECT(\"Sheet1!B\"&$A$1)` | `=INDIRECT(\"Sheet1!D\"&$A$1)` | `=INDIRECT(\"Sheet1!C\"&$A$1)` |\n| 3   | `=INDIRECT(\"Sheet1!E\"&$A$1)` | `=INDIRECT(\"Sheet1!F\"&$A$1)` | `=INDIRECT(\"Sheet1!H\"&$A$1)` | `=INDIRECT(\"Sheet1!G\"&$A$1)` |\n\n**Result in Sheet2:**\n\n|     | A   | B   | C   | D   |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1   | 101 |     |     |     |\n| 2   | Dep | 700 | 100 | Sta |\n| 3   | Sta | 300 | 900 | Dep |\n\n## Method 2: Using the INDEX Function\n\nThe `INDEX` function is a powerful and non-volatile alternative to `INDIRECT`. It returns a value or the reference to a value from within a table or range. It's generally preferred for performance reasons, especially in large workbooks.\n\n### How it Works\n\n`INDEX(array, row_num, [column_num])`\n\n*   `array`: The range of cells or an array from which to return a value.\n*   `row_num`: The row number in the `array` from which to return a value.\n*   `column_num` (optional): The column number in the `array` from which to return a value.\n\n### Step-by-Step Implementation\n\nUsing the same scenario:\n*   Source data in `Sheet1`.\n*   Row number in `Sheet2!A1`.\n*   Output in `Sheet2` starting from `A2`.\n\n**1. Set up the Row Number Input:**\n   In `Sheet2!A1`, enter the row number (e.g., `101`).\n\n**2. Enter the Formula for the First Cell (`Sheet2!A2`):**\n   To get the value from `Sheet1!A[row_number]`, enter this in `Sheet2!A2`:\n\n   ```excel\n   =INDEX(Sheet1!A:A, $A$1)\n   ```\n   *   `Sheet1!A:A`: This is the entire column A in Sheet1, which is our `array`.\n   *   `$A$1`: This provides the `row_num` to `INDEX`. Since we're referencing an entire column, the `row_num` directly corresponds to the absolute row number in `Sheet1`.\n\n**3. Extend to Other Columns:**\n   For `Sheet2!B2` (to get `Sheet1!B[row_number]`):\n\n   ```excel\n   =INDEX(Sheet1!B:B, $A$1)\n   ```\n\n   For `Sheet2!C2` (to get `Sheet1!C[row_number]`):\n\n   ```excel\n   =INDEX(Sheet1!D:D, $A$1)\n   ```\n   (Note: The original question had a reordering of columns, so `Sheet2!C2` pulls from `Sheet1!D` and `Sheet2!D2` pulls from `Sheet1!C`).\n\n   For `Sheet2!D2` (to get `Sheet1!C[row_number]`):\n\n   ```excel\n   =INDEX(Sheet1!C:C, $A$1)\n   ```\n\n**4. Extend to Other Rows (if your output spans multiple rows):**\n   For `Sheet2!A3` (to get `Sheet1!E[row_number]`):\n\n   ```excel\n   =INDEX(Sheet1!E:E, $A$1)\n   ```\n\n### Example Walkthrough (using INDEX)\n\n**Sheet1 Data (starting at row 101):**\n\n| A   | B   | C   | D   | E   | F   | G   | H   |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Dep | 700 | Sta | 100 | Sta | 300 | Dep | 900 |\n\n**Sheet2 Setup:**\n\n|     | A           | B   | C   | D   |\n| --- | ----------- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1   | 101         |     |     |     |\n| 2   | `=INDEX(Sheet1!A:A, $A$1)` | `=INDEX(Sheet1!B:B, $A$1)` | `=INDEX(Sheet1!D:D, $A$1)` | `=INDEX(Sheet1!C:C, $A$1)` |\n| 3   | `=INDEX(Sheet1!E:E, $A$1)` | `=INDEX(Sheet1!F:F, $A$1)` | `=INDEX(Sheet1!H:H, $A$1)` | `=INDEX(Sheet1!G:G, $A$1)` |\n\n**Result in Sheet2:**\n\n|     | A   | B   | C   | D   |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1   | 101 |     |     |     |\n| 2   | Dep | 700 | 100 | Sta |\n| 3   | Sta | 300 | 900 | Dep |\n\n## Common Problems & Solutions\n\n### #REF! Error with INDIRECT\n\n*   **Problem:** The `INDIRECT` function returns `#REF!`\n*   **Cause:** This usually means the text string you constructed does not refer to a valid cell or range. This can happen if the sheet name is misspelled, the column letter is incorrect, or the row number results in an out-of-bounds reference.\n*   **Solution:**\n    1.  **Check the constructed string:** Temporarily remove `INDIRECT` and just display the string: `= \"Sheet1!A\"&$A$1`. Does it look like a valid cell reference (e.g., \"Sheet1!A101\")?\n    2.  **Verify sheet name:** Ensure \"Sheet1\" (or whatever your sheet is named) is spelled exactly correctly, including spaces if any.\n    3.  **Check row number:** Make sure the value in `$A$1` is a valid row number within your sheet.\n\n### Performance Issues with INDIRECT\n\n*   **Problem:** Your Excel workbook becomes very slow to recalculate, especially with many formulas.\n*   **Cause:** `INDIRECT` is a volatile function. This means it recalculates every time *any* cell in the workbook changes, not just when its precedents change. In large workbooks, this can lead to significant performance degradation.\n*   **Solution:**\n    1.  **Switch to INDEX/MATCH:** As demonstrated in Method 2, `INDEX` is a non-volatile function and is generally more efficient for large datasets.\n    2.  **Limit `INDIRECT` usage:** If you must use `INDIRECT`, try to minimize its use or confine it to smaller, less frequently updated sections of your workbook.\n\n### Column Reordering Complexity\n\n*   **Problem:** The source data columns are not in the same order as the desired output columns, making formula dragging difficult.\n*   **Cause:** When dragging `INDIRECT(\"Sheet1!A\"&$A$1)` across, you have to manually change `A` to `B`, `C`, etc. If the output order is `A, B, D, C`, this becomes tedious.\n*   **Solution:**\n    1.  **Manual Adjustment:** For a small number of cells, manual adjustment is fine.\n    2.  **Use `COLUMN()` with `INDIRECT`:** You can make the column dynamic as well, but this adds complexity. For example, to get `Sheet1!A[row_num]` in `Sheet2!A2`, `Sheet1!B[row_num]` in `Sheet2!B2`, etc., you could use:\n        ```excel\n        =INDIRECT(\"Sheet1!\"&CHAR(64+COLUMN(A1))&$A$1)\n        ```\n        This formula uses `COLUMN(A1)` which returns 1, `CHAR(64+1)` which is 'A'. When dragged to `B2`, `COLUMN(B1)` returns 2, `CHAR(64+2)` is 'B'.\n    3.  **`INDEX` with `MATCH`:** For more complex reordering, `INDEX` combined with `MATCH` (to find the correct column) is the most robust solution, though it's more advanced than what the original question asked for.\n\n## Summary\n\nDynamically referencing cells in Excel based on a row number from another cell can be achieved effectively using either the `INDIRECT` or `INDEX` functions.\n\n*   **`INDIRECT`** is simpler for direct construction of cell addresses from text strings. It's easy to understand and implement for smaller, less performance-critical tasks. However, its volatile nature can lead to performance issues in large workbooks.\n*   **`INDEX`** is a more robust and performant alternative, especially for larger datasets. It works by specifying a range and then providing the row (and optional column) number within that range. While its syntax might seem slightly less intuitive for direct address construction, it offers better scalability.\n\nFor the scenario described, where you want to avoid VBA and have a manageable number of references, both methods are viable. If performance becomes an issue, migrating to `INDEX` is the recommended path.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### Q1: Why is `INDIRECT` considered \"volatile\"?\nA1: A volatile function is one that causes the entire workbook to recalculate every time any cell in the workbook changes, regardless of whether the change affects the volatile function's precedents. This can significantly slow down large or complex spreadsheets. `INDIRECT` is volatile because Excel cannot predict which cells it will reference until runtime, so it must re-evaluate it constantly.\n\n### Q2: Can I use `INDIRECT` or `INDEX` to reference a different sheet name dynamically?\nA2: Yes, both can be adapted.\n*   **`INDIRECT`:** If `Sheet2!B1` contains the sheet name (e.g., \"Sheet1\"), you could use:\n    ```excel\n    =INDIRECT($B$1&\"!A\"&$A$1)\n    ```\n*   **`INDEX`:** This is trickier as `INDEX` expects a direct range reference. You would typically need to combine it with `INDIRECT` if the sheet name itself is dynamic, or use a named range that refers to the dynamic sheet. For example, if you have a named range `MyDataRange` that refers to `Sheet1!A:H`, you could use `=INDEX(MyDataRange, $A$1, 1)` where `1` is the column number within `MyDataRange`.\n\n### Q3: What if my row number in `Sheet2!A1` is 0 or empty?\nA3:\n*   **`INDIRECT`:** If `$A$1` is 0 or empty, `INDIRECT` will likely return a `#REF!` error because \"Sheet1!A0\" or \"Sheet1!A\" are not valid cell references.\n*   **`INDEX`:** If `$A$1` is 0, `INDEX` will return a `#VALUE!` error as row numbers must be positive. If `$A$1` is empty, `INDEX` will treat it as 0 and also return `#VALUE!`.\nIt's good practice to add data validation to `Sheet2!A1` to ensure it always contains a valid row number.\n\n---\n\n## Image Generation Prompts\n\n**PLACEHOLDER-1:** A clean, modern flowchart diagram titled \"Dynamic Cell Reference Decision Tree\".\n- **Start Node:** \"Need dynamic cell reference?\" (Rectangle)\n- **Decision 1:** \"Row number in a cell?\" (Diamond)\n    - **Path Yes:** Leads to \"Performance critical or large dataset?\" (Diamond)\n    - **Path No:** Leads to \"Consider other lookup functions like VLOOKUP/HLOOKUP or XLOOKUP\" (Rectangle)\n- **Decision 2 (from Yes path):** \"Performance critical or large dataset?\" (Diamond)\n    - **Path Yes:** Leads to \"Use INDEX/MATCH\" (Rectangle)\n    - **Path No:** Leads to \"Use INDIRECT\" (Rectangle)\n- **INDEX/MATCH Node:** \"Use INDEX/MATCH\" (Rectangle)\n    - **Pros:** \"Non-volatile, better performance\" (Rectangle, smaller)\n    - **Cons:** \"More complex for simple row/column changes\" (Rectangle, smaller)\n- **INDIRECT Node:** \"Use INDIRECT\" (Rectangle)\n    - **Pros:** \"Simpler syntax for direct cell construction\" (Rectangle, smaller)\n    - **Cons:** \"Volatile function, can slow down large workbooks\" (Rectangle, smaller)\n- **End Node:** \"End\" (Rectangle)\n- **Arrows:** Clearly connect nodes according to the logic described in the mermaid diagram.

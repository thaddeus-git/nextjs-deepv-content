  "content": "# Executing Multi-Line Python Statements in a Single Command Line\n\nWhen working with Python from the command line, especially for scripting in tools like Makefiles, you often need to execute more complex logic than a simple one-liner. This includes importing modules, defining functions, or using control flow statements like `for` loops. Directly concatenating statements with semicolons (`python -c \"import sys; for r in range(10): print 'rob'\"`), as one might do in other languages, often leads to `SyntaxError` in Python due to how it handles compound statements.\n\nThis guide explores various robust methods to execute multi-line Python code, including imports and loops, directly from your shell's command line, ensuring compatibility and readability.\n\n## Quick Answer\n\nThe most common and robust ways to execute multi-line Python statements from the command line involve using `exec()` with escaped newlines, here-documents (`heredocs`), or piping the script to Python.\n\nFor example, using `exec()`:\n```bash\npython -c \"exec(\\\"import sys\\\\nfor r in range(10): print('rob')\\\")\"\n```\nOr using a here-document:\n```bash\npython - <<EOF\nimport sys\nfor r in range(10): print('rob')\nEOF\n```\n\n## Choose Your Method\n\nDeciding which method to use depends on your specific needs, such as readability, portability, and whether you need to pass shell variables.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Start: Need to run multi-line Python from command line?] --> B{One-liner required?};\n    B -- Yes --> C{Shell variable interpolation needed?};\n    B -- No --> D{Readability/Maintainability priority?};\n\n    C -- Yes --> C1{Bash/Zsh/Ksh?};\n    C1 -- Yes --> C2[Use ANSI C-quoted string ($'...') with sys.argv];\n    C1 -- No --> C3[Use printf %b with sys.argv];\n    C -- No --> E{Simple script, no shell vars?};\n    E -- Yes --> E1[Use `exec()` with escaped newlines];\n    E -- No --> F[Consider here-document or pipe];\n\n    D -- Yes --> D1[Use Here-document (<<EOF)];\n    D -- No --> G{Portability (Windows/Unix) critical?};\n    G -- Yes --> G1[Use `exec()` with triple quotes or escaped newlines];\n    G -- No --> H[Use pipe with `echo -e` or `printf %b`];\n\n    C2 --> End;\n    C3 --> End;\n    E1 --> End;\n    D1 --> End;\n    G1 --> End;\n    H --> End;\n```\n![Decision Tree for Multi-Line Python Command Line Execution](/images/2981476d-1.webp)\n\n## Table of Contents\n1.

Using `exec()` with Escaped Newlines\n\nThe `exec()` function in Python can execute dynamically created code. By embedding your multi-line Python script within a string and using `\\n` for newlines, you can pass a complete script to `python -c`. This is a highly versatile method.\n\n### Basic Usage\n```bash\npython -c \"exec(\\\"import sys\\\\nfor r in range(10): print('rob')\\\")\"\n```\nIn this example:\n-   `python -c` tells Python to execute the following string as a command.\n-   `exec(...)` is a Python function that takes a string and executes it as Python code.\n-   `\\\"import sys\\\\nfor r in range(10): print('rob')\\\"` is the string containing your Python script. Notice the double quotes around the entire string for the shell, and then escaped double quotes `\\\"` around the Python code itself. `\\\\n` represents a newline character within the Python string.\n\n### Python 2 vs. Python 3 `print`\nFor Python 3, `print` is a function, so `print('rob')` is used. For Python 2, `print 'rob'` would be correct. To make it cross-compatible, you might need conditional logic or stick to `sys.stdout.write`.\n\n### Cross-Platform with Triple Quotes\nFor better readability and cross-platform compatibility (especially on Windows), you can use Python's triple-quoted strings within `exec()`. This avoids excessive backslash escaping for newlines.\n\n```bash\npython -c \"exec(\\\"\\\"\\\"import sys\\\\nfor r in range(10): print('rob')\\\"\\\"\\\")\"\n```\nOr, for even cleaner syntax, if your shell allows:\n```bash\npython -c \"\"\"\nimport sys\nfor r in range(10): print('rob')\n\"\"\"\n```\nThis last example relies on the shell interpreting the triple quotes correctly, which might vary. The `exec()` with escaped newlines is generally more reliable across different shells.\n\n## 2. Using Here-Documents (`heredocs`)\n\nHere-documents (or `heredocs`) allow you to pass multi-line input directly to a command. This is often the most readable and maintainable solution for longer scripts.\n\n### Basic Here-Document\n```bash\npython - <<EOF\nimport sys\nfor r in range(10): print('rob')\nEOF\n```\n-   `python -` tells Python to read its script from standard input.\n-   `<<EOF` indicates the start of a here-document, with `EOF` as the delimiter. You can use any string as a delimiter, as long as it doesn't appear in your script.\n-   The lines between `<<EOF` and the final `EOF` are passed as the script.\n\n### Stripping Indentation\nTo allow indentation in your here-document for readability without affecting the Python script's execution, use `<<-EOF`:\n```bash\npython - <<-EOF\n    import sys\n    for r in range(10): print('rob')\nEOF\n```\nThe `<<-` syntax strips leading *tabs* (not spaces) from the lines. If you use spaces for indentation, they will remain.\n\n### Preventing Shell Expansion\nTo prevent the shell from performing parameter expansion (e.g., `$VAR`) or command substitution (e.g., `$(cmd)`) within the here-document, quote the delimiter:\n```bash\npython - <<'EOF'\nimport sys\n# This $PATH will not be expanded by the shell\nprint(f\"Current path: $PATH\")\nEOF\n```\n\n## 3. Piping Script to Python\n\nAnother straightforward method is to construct your multi-line script using `echo -e` (for shells that support ANSI escape sequences) or `printf %b` (for POSIX compliance) and pipe it to Python's standard input.\n\n### Using `echo -e`\n```bash\necho -e \"import sys\\nfor r in range(10): print('rob')\" | python\n```\n-   `echo -e` interprets backslash escapes like `\\n` as newlines.\n-   The `| python` pipes the output of `echo -e` directly to the Python interpreter.\n\n### Using `printf %b` (More Portable)\n`printf %b` is a more POSIX-compliant way to interpret backslash escapes, making it generally more portable than `echo -e`.\n```bash\nprintf %b \"import sys\\\\nfor r in range(10): print('rob')\" | python\n```\nNote that `\\\\n` is used here because `printf %b` itself interprets `\\n`, so to pass a literal `\\n` to Python, you need to escape the backslash for `printf`.\n\n## 4. ANSI C-Quoted Strings (`$'...'`) for Bash/Zsh/Ksh\n\nBash, Zsh, and Ksh support ANSI C-quoted strings (`$'...'`), which interpret backslash escapes directly. This can be a very clean one-liner solution.\n\n```bash\npython -c $'import sys\\\\nfor r in range(10): print(\"rob\")'\n```\n-   `$'...'` handles `\\n` as a newline.\n-   You need to escape single quotes within the string as `\\'` if they are part of your Python code. Double quotes within the Python code do not need escaping.\n\n### Passing Shell Variables\nThis method is excellent for passing shell variables into your Python script without complex escaping, by using `sys.argv`:\n```bash\nname='rob'\npython -c $'import sys\\\\nfor r in range(10): print(sys.argv[1])' \"$name\"\n```\nHere, `\"$name\"` is passed as a command-line argument to the Python script, accessible via `sys.argv[1]`.\n\n## 5. Using `printf %b` for POSIX Compliance\n\nFor maximum POSIX compliance, especially when dealing with shell variable interpolation, `printf %b` combined with `sys.argv` is a robust choice.\n\n```bash\npython -c \"$(printf %b 'import sys\\\\nfor r in range(10): print(\"rob\")')\"\n```\n-   `$(...)` performs command substitution, so `printf %b` generates the string, which is then passed to `python -c`.\n-   Single quotes `'...'` around the `printf` argument prevent shell expansion of variables or commands within the Python code string.\n-   `\\\\n` is used because `printf %b` interprets `\\n`.\n\n### Passing Shell Variables with `printf %b`\n```bash\nhome_dir=\"$HOME\"\npython -c \"$(printf %b 'import sys\\\\nfor r in range(10): print(\"Home: \" + sys.argv[1])')\" \"$home_dir\"\n```\nThis ensures that the shell variable `$HOME` is correctly passed as an argument to the Python script, which then accesses it via `sys.argv[1]`.\n\n## 6. Python 2 vs. Python 3 Considerations\n\nMany of the examples above use `print('rob')`, which is Python 3 syntax. If you are targeting Python 2, you would use `print 'rob'`.\n\n### Cross-Version `print`\nTo write code that works in both Python 2 and 3, you can use `sys.stdout.write()`:\n```bash\npython -c \"exec(\\\"import sys\\\\nfor r in range(10): sys.stdout.write('rob\\\\n')\\\")\"\n```\nOr, for Python 2, you could use a list comprehension with `sys.stdout.write`:\n```bash\npython2 -c \"import sys; [sys.stdout.write('rob\\\\n') for r in range(10)]\"\n```\nThis leverages the side effect of `sys.stdout.write` within a list comprehension to execute the print statement for each iteration.\n\n## 7. Common Problems & Solutions\n\n### `SyntaxError: invalid syntax`\nThis is the original problem. It occurs because Python's grammar does not allow compound statements (like `for` loops, `if` statements, `def` functions) to be directly preceded by other statements on the same line, separated only by a semicolon, when executed via `python -c`.\n**Solution:** Use `exec()` with newlines, here-documents, or pipe the script to Python.\n\n### Shell Expansion Issues\nIf your Python code contains characters like `$` or `` ` `` that the shell interprets, they might be expanded prematurely, leading to errors or unexpected behavior.\n**Solution:**\n-   Use single quotes (`'...'`) for the outer shell string where possible.\n-   Quote here-document delimiters (e.g., `<<'EOF'`).\n-   Pass values as arguments via `sys.argv` instead of embedding them directly.\n-   Use `printf %b` with single quotes for the format string.\n\n### Readability and Debugging\nLong, complex one-liners can be hard to read and debug.\n**Solution:**\n-   Prioritize here-documents (`<<EOF`) for longer scripts.\n-   Break down complex logic into a separate `.py` file if the script grows too large.\n-   Use `exec()` with triple quotes for better visual structure within the string.\n\n### Windows Compatibility\nSome shell features like `echo -e` or `heredocs` might behave differently or not be available in Windows command prompt (`cmd.exe`) or PowerShell.\n**Solution:**\n-   The `exec()` method with escaped newlines (`\\\\n`) is generally more portable across Windows and Unix-like systems.\n-   PowerShell has its own ways of handling multi-line strings and passing arguments.\n\n## Summary\n\nExecuting multi-line Python statements from the command line requires understanding how Python's grammar interacts with shell string parsing. While a simple `python -c \"stmt1; stmt2\"` works for simple statements, compound statements like `for` loops demand more sophisticated techniques.\n\nThe most robust and recommended methods include:\n-   **`exec()` with escaped newlines (`\\\\n`)**: Versatile and generally cross-platform.\n-   **Here-documents (`<<EOF`)**: Excellent for readability and longer scripts, especially with indentation stripping (`<<-EOF`).\n-   **Piping with `printf %b`**: Highly portable for simple scripts.\n-   **ANSI C-quoted strings (`$'...'`)**: Clean one-liner for Bash/Zsh/Ksh, good for `sys.argv` integration.\n\nFor complex or frequently used scripts, consider moving the logic into a dedicated `.py` file and calling it from your Makefile or shell script.\n\n---\n\n## Image Generation Prompts\n\n**PLACEHOLDER-1:** A decision tree flowchart.

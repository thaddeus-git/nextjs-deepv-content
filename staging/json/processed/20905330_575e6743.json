This guide will walk you through the steps to properly set up and use MOSS on your macOS system, addressing common issues like registration and script execution.\n\n## Quick Answer\n\nTo use MOSS, you must first register by sending an email to `moss@moss.stanford.edu` with `registeruser` and your email in the body. Once registered, you'll receive a personalized `moss.pl` script. Ensure `perl` is in your system's PATH, give the script execute permissions (`chmod ug+x moss.pl`), and then run it with your files, e.g., `./moss.pl -l python file1.py file2.py`.\n\n## Choose Your Method\n\nUsing the MOSS script primarily involves two stages: registration and execution. The main challenge often lies in ensuring the script is correctly set up and that you are a registered user.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Start] --> B{Have you registered for MOSS?};\n    B -- No --> C[Send Registration Email];\n    C --> D[Receive moss.pl script];\n    B -- Yes --> D;\n    D --> E{Is perl in your PATH?};\n    E -- No --> F[Adjust perl path in moss.pl];\n    E -- Yes --> G[Give moss.pl execute permissions];\n    G --> H[Run moss.pl with your files];\n    H --> I[Check MOSS results URL];\n    I --> J[End];\n\n    subgraph Registration\n        C\n    end\n\n    subgraph Setup\n        D --> E\n        E --> F\n        F --> G\n    end\n\n    subgraph Execution\n        G --> H\n        H --> I\n    end\n```\n\n## Ready-to-Use Code\n\nHere are the essential commands you'll need for setting up and running MOSS.\n\n### 1. Registering for MOSS\n\nSend an email to `moss@moss.stanford.edu` with the following body:\n\n```text\nregisteruser\nmail \"your_email@example.com\"\n```\n\nReplace `\"your_email@example.com\"` with your actual email address. You will receive a `moss.pl` script in response.\n\n### 2. Giving Execute Permissions\n\nOnce you have your `moss.pl` script, navigate to its directory in your terminal and run:\n\n```bash\nchmod ug+x moss.pl\n```\n\n### 3. Running the MOSS Script\n\nTo analyze Python files, for example:\n\n```bash\n./moss.pl -l python file_1.py file_2.py file_3.py\n```\n\nTo analyze a directory (if your script supports it, check comments in `moss.pl`):\n\n```bash\n./moss.pl -l python -d assignment1/\n```\n\n## Method 1: Proper MOSS Registration and Script Acquisition\n\nThe most critical step often overlooked is proper registration. MOSS requires you to register your email address to receive a personalized script (`moss.pl`) that contains your unique user ID. Without this, the service will not process your submissions correctly.\n\n1.  **Send Registration Email**: Compose an email to `moss@moss.stanford.edu`. The body of the email should contain:\n    ```text\n    registeruser\n    mail \"your_email@example.com\"\n    ```\n    Replace `\"your_email@example.com\"` with the email address you wish to register.\n    ![MOSS Registration Email Example](/images/575e6743-1.webp)\n2.  **Receive `moss.pl` Script**: After sending the registration email, you should receive a reply containing the `moss.pl` script. Save this file to a convenient location on your macOS system. This script will have your unique user ID embedded within it.\n\n## Method 2: Script Setup and Permissions on macOS\n\nOnce you have the `moss.pl` script, you need to ensure it's executable and that your system can find the `perl` interpreter.\n\n1.  **Verify Perl Path**: The `moss.pl` script is written in Perl. The very first line of the script typically specifies the path to the Perl interpreter (e.g., `#!/usr/bin/perl`). On macOS, `perl` is usually located at `/usr/bin/perl`. If your `perl` installation is in a different location, you might need to edit the first line of `moss.pl` to reflect the correct path.\n    ```perl\n    #!/usr/bin/perl\n    # The rest of the MOSS script follows\n    ```\n    You can check your Perl path by typing `which perl` in your terminal.\n2.  **Grant Execute Permissions**: Navigate to the directory where you saved `moss.pl` using your terminal. Then, grant execute permissions to the script:\n    ```bash\n    chmod ug+x moss.pl\n    ```\n    This command makes the script executable for the user and group, allowing you to run it directly.\n\n## Method 3: Executing the MOSS Script and Interpreting Results\n\nWith the script registered and set up, you can now submit your files for plagiarism detection.\n\n1.  **Submitting Files**:\n    *   **Individual Files**: The most common way to submit files is by listing them directly after the language flag. For Python files:\n        ```bash\n        ./moss.pl -l python file_1.py file_2.py file_3.py file_4.py\n        ```\n    *   **Directories**: Some versions of the `moss.pl` script (or specific configurations) might support submitting an entire directory. Check the comments within your `moss.pl` script for usage instructions, especially regarding the `-d` flag. If supported, it might look like this:\n        ```bash\n        ./moss.pl -l python -d assignment1/\n        ```\n        The original question's attempt to use `-d` might have failed if the specific `moss.pl` version didn't support it or if the directory structure wasn't as expected by the script.\n2.  **Understanding the Output**: When you run the script, you should see output similar to this:\n    ```output\n    Checking files . . .\n    OK\n    Uploading file_1.py ...done.\n    Uploading file_2.py ...done.\n    Query submitted.  Waiting for the server's response.\n    http://moss.stanford.edu/results/123456789.\n    ```\n    The crucial part is the `http://moss.stanford.edu/results/` URL. This is where your plagiarism report will be available. If you only get \"Checking files . . . OK\" and no URL, it usually indicates a registration issue or an incorrect script.\n    ![MOSS Script Successful Output](/images/575e6743-2.webp)\n3.  **Reviewing Results**: Open the provided URL in your web browser to view the detailed MOSS report, which highlights similarities between submitted files.\n\n## Common Problems & Solutions\n\n### Problem 1: \"Checking files . . . OK\" but no URL\n*   **Cause**: This is the most common symptom of not being properly registered or using a generic script without your user ID. The MOSS server rejects submissions from unregistered users.\n*   **Solution**: Ensure you have followed Method 1 precisely. You *must* receive the `moss.pl` script directly from Stanford after registration. The script you download from a public repository might not contain your user ID.\n\n### Problem 2: Permission Denied when running `./moss.pl`\n*   **Cause**: The script does not have execute permissions.\n*   **Solution**: Run `chmod ug+x moss.pl` in your terminal from the directory where the script is located (as described in Method 2).\n\n### Problem 3: `perl: command not found` or similar errors\n*   **Cause**: The `perl` interpreter is not in your system's PATH, or the shebang line (`#!/usr/bin/perl`) in `moss.pl` points to an incorrect location.\n*   **Solution**:\n    1.  Check your Perl installation: `which perl`.\n    2.  If `perl` is installed but in a different location (e.g., `/usr/local/bin/perl`), edit the first line of `moss.pl` to reflect the correct path.\n    3.  If `perl` is not installed, you'll need to install it (though it's usually pre-installed on macOS).\n\n### Problem 4: MOSS not detecting similarities even with identical files\n*   **Cause**: This is almost always due to an issue with registration or the script not being correctly processed by the MOSS server. The \"Checking files . . . OK\" message can be misleading if no actual submission occurs.\n*   **Solution**: Re-verify your registration and ensure you are using the `moss.pl` script provided by Stanford after your registration email. The problem description indicates this was the original issue, resolved by the user after receiving their official script.\n\n## Summary\n\nSuccessfully using the MOSS script on macOS involves a few critical steps:\n1.  **Register** your email with Stanford to obtain your personalized `moss.pl` script.\n2.  **Configure** the script by ensuring the correct Perl path and granting execute permissions.\n3.  **Execute** the script with your target files, paying attention to the output for the results URL.\n\nAlways prioritize using the `moss.pl` script you receive directly from Stanford after registration, as it contains your unique identifier necessary for the service to function correctly.\n\n---\n\n## Image Generation Prompts\n\n**PLACEHOLDER-1:** A screenshot of an email client (like Gmail or Outlook) showing a new email being composed. The recipient field should be `moss@moss.stanford.edu`. The subject line can be empty or \"MOSS Registration\".
